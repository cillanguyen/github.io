later took CSE 154 where I learned how to advance my javascript with React, HTML
and CSS.

: **second-lang:** I learned python when I took CSE 160 and CSE 163. I really
enjoy working with Python because it's a bit of a more advance language then R.

: **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** I know SQL and QGIS which isn't a common
language that everyone know. Since it's not use quite often in the programming
field.
